# EP-390 Final Project Gettings Started

1. make sure you have a camera that can be accessed and that max has permission to use said camera. 
2. Install the max patch (in addition to Max 9) AND that you have a license for rnbo (also install rnbo).
3. In the folder with you patch there needs to be the ```hands-landmarks-index.js``` file, the ```EP390_Hand_Gesture_Recognition.js```file, the ```mesh-style.css``` file, and the ```EP390_Hand_Gesture_Recognition.html``` file.
4. ensure that your audio setup is correct in Max settings.
5. Lock your Patcher.
6. Play around with using closed fists, open palms, and pointing your index finger up to get different instruments in your patch (left hand has chorus and right hand has reverb)
